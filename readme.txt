   Free(b)soft CDROM is a complete system for blind and visually impaired users that runs directly from a CD.
   It does not need to be installed before using.  The operating system is GNU/Linux and primary working
   environment is GNU Emacs with speech support (Festival through Speech Dispatcher).
   
   To get started with Free(b)soft CDROM immediately:
   
      * Put this CD into the CD drive.
      * Make sure the BIOS is set up to boot from CD (before the hard disk).
      * Restart your computer.
    
   You don't have to be afraid.  Your hard disk will not be used at all, thus your data will not be damaged.
   
   After the system starts, you will be able to try reading, writing, working with Internet, e-mail and
   variety of other applications with speech output.  If you have a Braille terminal, you should be able to
   use it as well.
   
   System Requirements
   
   You need an ordinary PC with the following configuration:
   
      * Intel-compatible CPU at 600 MHz or better,
      * 128 MB RAM,
      * bootable CD-ROM/DVD drive,
      * standard SVGA-compatible graphics card,
      * sound card. 
   
   Braille display is not required, however if you connect an ALVA device to ttyS0 (COM1), it should be
   recognized and used. Other models must be configured manually.
   		    
   If you have problems to get the system working, it is possible that your hardware is not supported or
   properly configured.
